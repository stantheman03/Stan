<strong>If the standard model for Hollywood marriage is either celebrity pairing or quiet consortship (a spouse outside the limelight, a supportive partner on the running board of the career), Amal Clooney quickly flouted such customs. 
She was not a celebrity, yet she rose to fame’s conventions and constraints. At the same time, she remained carefully herself, heralding a subtle, welcome change in social expectation on the way. 
Once, a high-achieving working woman would have been trapped in the shadow of her leading man. 
Now you go out evenings and expect to find women outshining, in their brilliance and accomplishment, whoever dangles on their arm—even George Clooney.

“She’s the professional, and I’m the amateur,” says George, who’s done a share of humanitarian work on his own. 
“I get to see someone at the absolute top of their game doing their job better than anybody I’ve ever seen.” 
He was not alone in feeling so, and a shower of jokes followed news of their vows across their world. 
“Internationally Acclaimed Barrister Amal Alamuddin Marries an Actor,” went one version of a popular headline gag. 
At the 2015 Golden Globes, Tina Fey met their match with a punch line: “Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected for a three-person U.N. commission,” she said onstage. 
“So tonight her husband is getting a lifetime-achievement award.” Nobody in the audience seemed to laugh more joyfully than George.
